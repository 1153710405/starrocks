# StarRocks

Docs repository

## Tips

- Images should be put into `./assets`, and used like:

  ```markdown
  ![test image](../../assets/test.png)
  ```

  or

  ```markdown
  ![test image](./assets/test.png)
  ```

- All markdown files are indexed in `TOC.md`which is used to render the sidebar of the website. `File links in the TOC.md should be absolute path.`
- Code blocks writen with no language specified are forbidden.
- Docs that need to be used as `help xxx` in StarRocks should be put into `./sql-referernce`.
- No special charactors allowed in markdown filesã€‚
