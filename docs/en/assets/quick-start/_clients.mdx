These three clients are tested with this tutorial, you only need one:

- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/) is available as a community version and a Pro version. 
- [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
- mysql CLI: The mysql client is packaged with MySQL Server. If you do use this client you might want to disable the MySQL server unless you plan to use that in addition to the client.
